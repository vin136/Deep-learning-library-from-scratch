This is a deep learning library all implemented in numpy.The objective being to improve my personal clarity.This is inspired from joel grus coding madness youtube video.
We will start with a plan:<br/>
1.Tensors <br/>
2.Loss functions <br/>
3.layers <br/>
4.optimizers<br/>
5.neural nets <br/>
6.data <br/>
